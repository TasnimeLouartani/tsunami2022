Abstract :

Recent tsunami events are studied in depth to improve tsunami early warning systems and tsunami
models using GNSS technology. Many devastating tsunamis are generated over, or under the oceans,
however our observing capacity is located on land: the oceans being a geodetic desert. To fill this
gap, we could use geodetic techniques on board of ships to track changes in sea-surface height and
detect even small, around 10 cm amplitude, tsunamis. Using one year of Automatic Idenfitication
System (AIS) data of commercial ships crossing the Pacific Ocean, this study aims to realize a
statistical coverage showing a density of ships in a world grid. The maps are plotted with PyGMT
and identify locations of ships on an hourly average per year, season and month. The maps show a
permanent presence of ships next to the coast, especially in East Asia, and a pronounced absence
in the southern Pacific Ocean. A seasonal pattern is detected with more ships on sea in winter and
autumn. Afterwards, by comparing their locations to the tsunami sources, first insights can be drawn
on how effective this geodetic technique could help early warning systems.
